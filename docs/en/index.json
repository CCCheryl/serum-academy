	"content": "Serum Ecosystem The nodes recently voted in favor of the following proposition, creating an initiative to fund projects building on Serum coordinated by EcoSerum, one of Project Serum\u0026rsquo;s nodes. Furthermore, 2% of all Serum fees will be used to fund new projects through EcoSerum.\nFunding and Tokens If you’re building a new project on Serum, you can coordinate with EcoSerum on the following terms:\n  EcoSerum will have grants available for promising proposals. This will be funded primarily with 2% of all Serum fees. To kick start things, the EcoSerum Project Funding Pool (EPFP) has been seeded with 200,000 locked SRM tokens and 1 locked MegaSerum (MSRM).\n These are (M)SRM tokens that are fully locked until 2021-08-01 and then unlock linearly over the following 6 years.    Any promising project will be eligible for a grant of between 1,000 and 20,000 unlocked SRM tokens to pre-launch.\n  Each project that receives a grant will get a further grant of SRM upon project launch. EcoSerum will decide on the second grant size post-launch depending on the project’s execution, ranging from 5,000 SRM to 100,000 SRM, locked 1-7 years.\n  For some projects general to Solana, there may be an additional 25 SOL granted for every 100 SRM.\n  Each project that receives a grant and successfully launches will also have a 1% chance of winning the MegaSerum!\n  Each project can choose to implement a fee/revenue model that is integrated into Project Serum. If they do:\n The Serum nodes will help in managing the project and its revenue There will be an SPL token minted for the project; call it TA. 100% of the revenue/fees/etc. of the project will go to a weekly buy/burn of TA. The project team will be granted 20% of TA tokens; 1% unlocked, 19% with a 1-7 year lock. In the case of a massive/complicated project and/or which does not come from the community’s blueprint, these terms are negotiable with EcoSerum. 1% of TA will be distributed to EcoSerum stakers, pro-rata, 1-7 year lock. The other 79% of TA tokens will be distributed pro-rata to all SRM tokens staked (any SRM can be staked, whether locked or unlocked, and there is no minimum quantity). Unlocked SRM holders will receive unlocked TA; locked SRM holders will receive 1-7 year locked TA. Rather than giving one grant up-front, the locked TA will be distributed over the next 7 years to locked SRM. The nodes will manage the entire process, integrating it into the SRM buy/burns and staking. The nodes will coordinate to help TA get listed on Serum with an IDO (initial dex offering) and supported by major Serum GUIs. The nodes will coordinate to get liquidity providers to support TA markets. The nodes will support it with standard node duties, including cranking, cross-chain support, and more    "

	"content": "Create your SOL wallet \u0026amp; Deposit Funds Serum is built on the Solana blockchain, so the first step is to create a SOL wallet. For this we recommend using Sollet.io.\nOnce you arrive on Sollet.io for the first time you have the possibility to create a new wallet. You will be given seed words, make sure to save them offline somewhere safe. This is the only way you can recover your wallet, don’t lose them!\nOnce you have noted down your seeds, you will have the possibility to add a password to your Sollet.io wallet. Even though this is optional, it is highly recommended for your own security.\nOnce the password is set (or not) you have successfully created your SOL wallet. The next step will be to send SOL to your deposit address. SOL can be bought on several exchanges like Binance or FTX.\nNow, let’s add some SOL to our wallet. For this you need to click on Receive. A pop up will appear with your SOL address. Use this address to send SOL from an exchange. (Only send SOL to this address, do not send SPL tokens (e.g. SRM) to this address)\nNow that you have some SOL in your wallet you can create another SPL address in your wallet. For this click on the + icon in the top right corner. A pop up will appear, you will have the possibility to add a popular SPL token such as: SRM, MSRM, FTT, BTC, ETH, LINK XRP, USDT, USDC. Then deposit your USDC, USDT, XRP, LINK, YFI, FTT, ETH, and/or BTC into your FTX account. Enter in your Sollet deposit address for the crypto you would like to withdraw and FTX will automatically wrap your crypto in an SPL token to be used with the Serum dex. Please note that to convert wrapped SPL assets back into their native chain, you can deposit into FTX and withdraw the unwrapped assets.\nYou can see that below your SOL address a SRM address appeared. You can use this address to send and receive funds to your Sollet.io wallet.\nIf you would like to add another token that\u0026rsquo;s not on the Popular Token list, you can add it manually by entering the Mint Address of the token.\n.\nNow we have deposited some tokens in our Sollet.io wallet. Time to do a trade on Serum!\nThe Token Address or Mint Address is the contract address of a token i.e the token identifier, do not send tokens to this address.\n The Deposit Address is the address where you deposit a token to.\n "

	"content": "Project Ideas If you want to know how to get involved on these projects see our dedicated page: Getting involved\nFeel free to reach out to us if you are interested in any of these projects:\n EcoSerum website: https://www.ecoserum.dev/ EcoSerum Telegram: @ecoSerum Email: contact@projectserum.com Twitter: @ProjectSerum Discord: Project Serum  AMM Bot Building an open source system that people can use to achieve AMM-like behavior on Serum’s orderbooks.\nDetails can be found on Ecoserum website: https://www.ecoserum.dev/\nIf you build it to the below specs, it will receive a predetermined bounty instead of the variable one.\nBounty: 75k locked SRM\nSpecs:\n  Can support 2-token AMM or more\n  Must trade via the orderbooks\n Send post-only orders to replicate the curve    Parameters must be reasonable\n  Must be functional\n  Must have pool tokens\n  Must be open source\n  Must be able to launch new AMMs with arbitrary SPL tokens\n  Note: A draft of an implementation of AMMs on Solana can be found on the GitHub account of Solana Labs.\nDumplings A yield farming token that is integrated into an AMM system on Serum.\nHere is an idea of what it could look like:\n  Build a \u0026ldquo;pool\u0026rdquo; which starts at 100 SRM + 100 SOL per pool token. It\u0026rsquo;s just an ETF — you can\u0026rsquo;t actually trade against the pool.\n  The pool automatically does the on-chain AMM-style market making on the Serum SRM/SOL market. Basically this means; a liquidity providing strategy such that, if SRM/SOL goes from price A → B → A, the pool’s valuation will at worst be unchanged. The pool will be fully on-chain and its behavior will be well defined from creation.\n  You can \u0026lsquo;create\u0026rsquo; into the pool by delivering the basket. So at the beginning if you send in 200 SRM + 200 SOL you get 2 SPT (Serum Pool Tokens). If after an hour of trading the pool was 150 SRM + 80 SOL then to create 2 SPT you\u0026rsquo;d deposit 300 SRM + 160 SOL.\n  You can redeem your SPTs for the fractional share of the pool.\n  The pool gets the proceeds of its trading, including maker rebates\n  Each day, 10,000 Dumplings are added to the pool for the first 100 days; then no more Dumplings are created. When a Dumpling contract is first created, 100,000 Dumplings (DUM) are airdropped on all SRM holders to seed liquidity for joining the pool.\n  This means that:\n  If you redeem your SPTs after 5 days and you were half the pool, you\u0026rsquo;d get back your SRM/SOL, and also 25,000 Dumplings. You can trade those on the DUM/USDC market or whatever.\n  If after 5 days you want to join the SRM/SOL MM pool for, say, 100 SRM + 100 SOL, you\u0026rsquo;d have to send in: 100 SRM, 100 SOL, and some DUM (maybe 15,000, depending on how large the pool had been/how many DUM are in 1 SPT).\n  This means that entering the MM pool is gated by buying/owning Dumplings, and you get Dumplings each day for providing liquidity.\nBorrow/Lending If you build it to the below specs, it will receive a predetermined bounty instead of the variable one.\nBounty: maximum (100k locked SRM)\nSpecs:\n  Can be isolated between pairs, or cross between all pairs\n  Must at least include the following SPL tokens: USDT, USDC, BTC, ETH, SOL (or wrapped SOL), SRM, FTT, SUSHI, MSRM, YFI, LINK.\n  Must be seamlessly composable onto trades\n  Parameters must be reasonable\n  Must be functional\n  Fees must be either:\n  Predetermined at the creation of a pool\n  Set via a vote of SRM nodes\n  Set via a vote of the protocol’s token\n  100% of fees paid to BORROW/LENDING token\n Consistent with the general EcoSerum token plan    Must be open source\n  Must be able to launch new books with arbitrary SPL tokens\n  Sushi Swap Notes: This is submitted on behalf of EcoSerum, a Serum node. Serum Academy is involved in the development of Serum but has not been involved in the development of Sushi in any way.\nProposal  The Sushi community builds out support for Sushiswap on Solana Sushi rewards are paid to both Ethereum and Solana/Serum based Sushiswap  Proportional to the TLV in each Or alternately fixed to each pool Open to other suggestions as well\u0026ndash;what’s fair?   The Sushi community composes this with the Serum orderbooks  Each Sushi pool has a curve, currently constant-product The pool sends bids/offers into the associated Serum orderbook to simulate that curve This allows the Sushi AMM to share liquidity and volume with the orderbook There are maker rebates on Serum orderbooks that the AMMs would capture; they can also add on their own fees   FTX has a bridge from ERC20 \u0026lt;\u0026gt; SPL (Solana token) Sushi; in the next week, Sollet.io will as well Sushi will also be able to compose with a borrow/lending protocol on Serum to allow the pools to trade on margin, though that’s not necessary for V1 To clarify: Sushi would not be moving off of Etherum in any way; this would be an addition, not a replacement.  Rewards  EcoSerum, a Serum node that helps build out the community, will give the following rewards: 50k SRM for 1+2 1 locked MegaSerum for 1-5  One MegaSerum is 1 million Serum put together This will allow the Sushi community to participate in Serum, run a node, receive yield, benefit from a buy/burn, and receive discounts This will be locked (not sellable or transferable) for 1-7 years: fully locked until Aug 1 2021, and then unlocking linearly over the 6 years after that   These rewards are for the Sushi community, controlled by governance, to do what they want with In addition, 20k SRM for 1+2 and another 10k for 1-5 to the team who builds it  Timeline The target would be for pieces of this to roll out within a month, and completion before the end of 2020. The assumption is that work would not start in earnest until after the Sushiswap migration is complete.\nCross-Chain Bridges It would be awesome to have fully on-chain bridges between Solana and as many other chains as possible. See prospective specs for one here, but there are many other versions!\nSwipe Integration Build a project with the following properties:\n Swipe generates a new Solana wallet address A, gets the private key Swipe creates another Solana wallet address A2 controlled by the first one and passes that secret key on to the user When an incoming payment request comes for $D, Swipe: (a) freezes withdrawals from A2 and everything it owns; (b) adds up the value of assets in A2 and everything it owns; and (c) determines if it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026gt; D or not. If so it sells assets into USDC until it hits D on the Serum orderbooks, withdraws that, and then approves the request; otherwise it denies it. Optional: Tack on 0.25% of fees for the transactions and use those to buy/burn an SPL token T; T has 1b total tokens and airdrops them over 7 years onto SRM stakers, possibly + SPL SXP holders Reward: 20% of T tokens, 1-7 year lockup  Cross-Chain Lending Assets can be pre-funded across the bridge and allow users to avoid waiting for cross-chain synchronization for a fee. For example, a user could deposit X eth into the bridge as collateral, and be able to withdraw any pre-funded assets up to some limit.\nSerum Oracle An on-chain oracle that takes prices from Serum markets, does sophisticated risk and sanity checks on them, and creates a clean price feed that other projects working on Serum can use. Furthermore, once there are on-chain cross-chain bridges, those can be combined with this to create a fully on-chain cross-chain pricing oracle.\nSerum RFQ Generate a tradable RFQ from the Serum order book. The generated quote can be valid for a limited time and backed by an insurance pool. It would have a size attached, and potentially be larger and wider than would be typical for orderbook trading.\nDecentralized Wrappers An on-chain method of wrapping an ERC20 token into an SPL token and vice versa.\nSynthetic Assets Building out support for tokenized synthetic assets on Serum.\nVolatility Products Building out markets or tokenized products representing volatility or other nonlinear functions of markets.\nZero Knowledge Liquidation Engine PoC for ZK liquiditations, where it’s zk to the network, but not zk to the defi platform operators. The engine should be able to use the on chain order book price or funding rate as a witness, and generate a proof that states the contract is now ‘in the money’ or ‘out of the money’ and take an action from there.\nNative Metamask Integration See this introduction to Web3 Plugins for more details\nMobile App If you build it to the below specs, it will receive a predetermined bounty instead of the variable one.\nBounty: 50k locked SRM\nSpecs:\n  Generally well built\n  Built in self-custody wallet that supports SPL tokens and SOL\n  Supports the core functions of https://serum-academy.com/en/dex-list/\n  Released on apple and android app stores\n  Note you will also get GUI rewards\n  Badges Badges to represent participation in various aspects of Serum; e.g. liquidity providing, node operating.\nGUI \u0026amp; Other Ideas Below is a list of GUI \u0026amp; other features that could be developed:\n Button on Sollet.io to mint your own SPL token Graphs on the DEX GUI Button to create a Serum market Market orders on GUI Ledger support for Sollet.io Volume and other metric trackers for Serum A tool to validate GUIs against the source code Build support for on-chain triggered orders (stop losses, take profits) into Serum.
