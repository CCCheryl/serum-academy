	"content": "Serum Ecosystem The nodes recently voted in favor of the following proposition, creating an initiative to fund projects building on Serum coordinated by EcoSerum, one of Project Serum\u0026rsquo;s nodes. Furthermore, 2% of all Serum fees will be used to fund new projects through EcoSerum.\nFunding and Tokens If you’re building a new project on Serum, you can coordinate with EcoSerum on the following terms:\n  EcoSerum will have grants available for promising proposals. This will be funded primarily with 2% of all Serum fees. To kick start things, the EcoSerum Project Funding Pool (EPFP) has been seeded with 200,000 locked SRM tokens and 1 locked MegaSerum (MSRM).\n These are (M)SRM tokens that are fully locked until 2021-08-01 and then unlock linearly over the following 6 years.    Any promising project will be eligible for a grant of between 1,000 and 20,000 unlocked SRM tokens to pre-launch.\n  Each project that receives a grant will get a further grant of SRM upon project launch. EcoSerum will decide on the second grant size post-launch depending on the project’s execution, ranging from 5,000 SRM to 100,000 SRM, locked 1-7 years.\n  For some projects general to Solana, there may be an additional 25 SOL granted for every 100 SRM.\n  Each project that receives a grant and successfully launches will also have a 1% chance of winning the MegaSerum!\n  Each project can choose to implement a fee/revenue model that is integrated into Project Serum. If they do:\n The Serum nodes will help in managing the project and its revenue There will be an SPL token minted for the project; call it TA. 100% of the revenue/fees/etc. of the project will go to a weekly buy/burn of TA. The project team will be granted 20% of TA tokens; 1% unlocked, 19% with a 1-7 year lock. In the case of a massive/complicated project and/or which does not come from the community’s blueprint, these terms are negotiable with EcoSerum. 1% of TA will be distributed to EcoSerum stakers, pro-rata, 1-7 year lock. The other 79% of TA tokens will be distributed pro-rata to all SRM tokens staked (any SRM can be staked, whether locked or unlocked, and there is no minimum quantity). Unlocked SRM holders will receive unlocked TA; locked SRM holders will receive 1-7 year locked TA. Rather than giving one grant up-front, the locked TA will be distributed over the next 7 years to locked SRM. The nodes will manage the entire process, integrating it into the SRM buy/burns and staking. The nodes will coordinate to help TA get listed on Serum with an IDO (initial dex offering) and supported by major Serum GUIs. The nodes will coordinate to get liquidity providers to support TA markets. The nodes will support it with standard node duties, including cranking, cross-chain support, and more    "

	"content": "Create your SOL wallet \u0026amp; Deposit Funds The first step is to create a Sollet.io wallet. Your Sollet.io wallet can be funded with SOL or with ETH that will be converted to SOL using the convert function of Sollet.io.\nOnce you arrive on Sollet.io for the first time you have the possibility to create a new wallet. You will be given seed words, make sure to save them offline somewhere safe. This is the only way you can recover your wallet, don’t lose them!\nOnce you have noted down your seeds, you will have the possibility to add a password to your Sollet.io wallet. Even though this is optional, it is highly recommended for your own security.\nOnce the password is set (or not) you have successfully created your SOL wallet. The next step will be to send SOL to your deposit address. SOL can be bought on several exchanges like Binance, FTX or FTX US.\nNow, let’s add some SOL to our wallet. For this you need to click on Receive. A pop up will appear with your SOL address. Use this address to send SOL from an exchange. (Only send SOL to this address, do not send SPL tokens (e.g. SRM) to this address)\nYou can also fund your wallet with ETH and convert it to SOL. For this, click on the ETH tab and connect to your Metamask wallet.\nNow that you have some SOL in your wallet, you can create another SPL address in your wallet. To add another address click on the + icon in the top right corner. A pop up will appear, you will have the possibility to add a popular SPL token such as: SRM, MSRM, FTT, BTC, ETH, LINK XRP, USDT, USDC. Now that you have added an address you can deposit tokens in different ways:\n  You can deposit ERC20 tokens and convert them to SPL tokens using the convert function of Sollet.io and Metamask (to learn how to convert ERC20 to SPL please refer to the dedicated section below).\n  You can use FTX to deposit tokens (ERC20, XRP, BTC etc) and withdraw from FTX to Sollet.io. FTX will automatically wrap your crypto in an SPL token to be used with the Serum DEX. Please note that to convert wrapped SPL assets back into their native chain, you can deposit into FTX and withdraw the unwrapped assets.\n  You can see that below your SOL address a SRM address appeared. You can use this address to send and receive funds to your Sollet.io wallet.\nIf you would like to add another token that\u0026rsquo;s not on the Popular Token list, you can add it manually by entering the Mint Address of the token.\n.\nConvert ERC20 to SPL tokens Sollet.io allows you to convert ERC20 to SPL and vice versa using your MetaMask Wallet.\nTo do so, click on the token you would like to deposit, once deposit pops open click on the ERC20 Tab\n.\nNow, click on CONNECT TO METAMASK, a MetaMask pop up will open, click on Confirm.\nOnce your wallet is connected enter the amount of ERC20 you would like to convert and click on CONVERT. A MetaMask pop up will open to confirm the transaction and set the gas fees:\n.\nThen wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain\n.\nOnce the transaction is confirmed the funds will be available in your wallet.\nNow we have deposited some tokens in our Sollet.io wallet. Time to do a trade on Serum!\nYou can use the convert function of Sollet.io to deposit ETH and ERC20 tokens to your Sollet.io wallet.\n The Token Address or Mint Address is the contract address of a token i.e the token identifier, do not send tokens to this address.\n The Deposit Address is the address where you deposit a token to.\n "

There are lots of variants and customizability but here are some ideas:\n AMMs that trade on Serum\u0026rsquo;s markets AMMs with more than two components AMMs with easy to customize curves  If you build it to the below specs, it will receive a predetermined bounty instead of the variable one.\nBounty: 75k locked SRM\nSpecs:\n  Parameters must be reasonable\n  Must be functional\n  Must have pool tokens\n  Must be open source\n  Must be able to launch new AMMs with arbitrary SPL tokens\n  Note: A draft of an implementation of AMMs on Solana can be found on the GitHub account of Solana Labs.\nSushi Swap Notes: This is submitted on behalf of EcoSerum, a Serum node. Serum Academy is involved in the development of Serum but has not been involved in the development of Sushi in any way.\nProposal  The Sushi community builds out support for Sushiswap on Solana Sushi rewards are paid to both Ethereum and Solana/Serum based Sushiswap  Proportional to the TLV in each Or alternately fixed to each pool Open to other suggestions as well\u0026ndash;what’s fair?   The Sushi community composes this with the Serum orderbooks  Each Sushi pool has a curve, currently constant-product The pool sends bids/offers into the associated Serum orderbook to simulate that curve This allows the Sushi AMM to share liquidity and volume with the orderbook There are maker rebates on Serum orderbooks that the AMMs would capture; they can also add on their own fees   FTX has a bridge from ERC20 \u0026lt;\u0026gt; SPL (Solana token) Sushi; in the next week, Sollet.io will as well Sushi will also be able to compose with a borrow/lending protocol on Serum to allow the pools to trade on margin, though that’s not necessary for V1 To clarify: Sushi would not be moving off of Etherum in any way; this would be an addition, not a replacement.  Rewards  EcoSerum, a Serum node that helps build out the community, will give the following rewards: 50k SRM for 1+2 1 locked MegaSerum for 1-5  One MegaSerum is 1 million Serum put together This will allow the Sushi community to participate in Serum, run a node, receive yield, benefit from a buy/burn, and receive discounts This will be locked (not sellable or transferable) for 1-7 years: fully locked until Aug 1 2021, and then unlocking linearly over the 6 years after that   These rewards are for the Sushi community, controlled by governance, to do what they want with In addition, 20k SRM for 1+2 and another 10k for 1-5 to the team who builds it  Messaging Application Bounty: Bounty of 25k locked SRM\nBuild an instant messaging app on Solana with the following:\n The app would pass encrypted messages over the network The app would be fully on-chain Build a GUI for people to chat with each other The app could be directly integrated to Serum DEX GUI  Yield Farming A yield farming token that is integrated into an AMM system on Serum.\nHere is an idea of what it could look like:\n  Build a \u0026ldquo;pool\u0026rdquo; which starts at 100 SRM + 100 SOL per pool token. It\u0026rsquo;s just an ETF — you can\u0026rsquo;t actually trade against the pool.\n  The pool automatically does the on-chain AMM-style market making on the Serum SRM/SOL market. Basically this means; a liquidity providing strategy such that, if SRM/SOL goes from price A → B → A, the pool’s valuation will at worst be unchanged. The pool will be fully on-chain and its behavior will be well defined from creation.\n  You can \u0026lsquo;create\u0026rsquo; into the pool by delivering the basket. So at the beginning if you send in 200 SRM + 200 SOL you get 2 SPT (Serum Pool Tokens). If after an hour of trading the pool was 150 SRM + 80 SOL then to create 2 SPT you\u0026rsquo;d deposit 300 SRM + 160 SOL.\n  You can redeem your SPTs for the fractional share of the pool.\n  The pool gets the proceeds of its trading, including maker rebates\n  Each day, 10,000 Dumplings are added to the pool for the first 100 days; then no more Dumplings are created. When a Dumpling contract is first created, 100,000 Dumplings (DUM) are airdropped on all SRM holders to seed liquidity for joining the pool.\n  This means that:\n  If you redeem your SPTs after 5 days and you were half the pool, you\u0026rsquo;d get back your SRM/SOL, and also 25,000 Dumplings. You can trade those on the DUM/USDC market or whatever.\n  If after 5 days you want to join the SRM/SOL MM pool for, say, 100 SRM + 100 SOL, you\u0026rsquo;d have to send in: 100 SRM, 100 SOL, and some DUM (maybe 15,000, depending on how large the pool had been/how many DUM are in 1 SPT).\n  This means that entering the MM pool is gated by buying/owning Dumplings, and you get Dumplings each day for providing liquidity.\nBorrow/Lending If you build it to the below specs, it will receive a predetermined bounty instead of the variable one.\nBounty: maximum (100k locked SRM)\nSpecs:\n  Can be isolated between pairs, or cross between all pairs\n  Must at least include the following SPL tokens: USDT, USDC, BTC, ETH, SOL (or wrapped SOL), SRM, FTT, SUSHI, MSRM, YFI, LINK.\n  Must be seamlessly composable onto trades\n  Parameters must be reasonable\n  Must be functional\n  Fees must be either:\n  Predetermined at the creation of a pool\n  Set via a vote of SRM nodes\n  Set via a vote of the protocol’s token\n  100% of fees paid to BORROW/LENDING token\n Consistent with the general EcoSerum token plan    Must be open source\n  Must be able to launch new books with arbitrary SPL tokens\n  Serum Oracle An on-chain oracle that takes prices from Serum markets, does sophisticated risk and sanity checks on them, and creates a clean price feed that other projects working on Serum can use. Furthermore, once there are on-chain cross-chain bridges, those can be combined with this to create a fully on-chain cross-chain pricing oracle.\nSpecs:\n Takes in arbitrary signals  Can take from multiple sources Combines in a reasonable way   Has reasonable error handling and outlier handling Writes on-chain Some way to charge people for querying it on-chain A built-in way to use Serum orderbooks as an oracle  Token Minter Panel A token minter panel with the following specs:\n Mint SPL tokens Specify an address and market  Funds there go to buy/burn that token on that market If the funds are that token they’re natively burnt   Options to be able to keep minting, or probably throw away the key to mint more  SPL Name Service Create a table where the mint of a token can submit a name for their token. Also create a table where a token controls governance of the naming. If you create this, EcoSerum will support the token\u0026rsquo;s adoption; you get 20% of them.\nCross-Chain Bridges It would be awesome to have fully on-chain bridges between Solana and as many other chains as possible. Cross-chain bridges would be decentralized. See prospective specs for one on Sollet.io, but there are many other versions!\nExchanges If you are an exchange and want to add Solana, SRM and SPL support please reach out to us.\nNative Metamask Integration Native MetaMask integration for Solana, SRM and SPL tokens. See this introduction to Web3 Plugins for more details\nGUI Improvements Below is a list of GUI improvements that could be developed:\n Button on Sollet.io to mint your own SPL token Ledger support for Sollet.io Volume and other metric trackers for Serum A tool to validate GUIs against the source code Build support for on-chain triggered orders (stop losses, take profits) into Serum. Add Ledger support on Serum DEX UI  See Project Serum GitHub account for the source of Sollet.io and the DEX GUI\n"

	"content": "Awarded Grants See the list of awarded grants below:\nBonfida Bonfida arose from a need for more accurate, unbiased and in-depth exchange data. Whilst the data is accessible via API, it\u0026rsquo;s not easy to parse and the interpreted data from exchanges themselves is borderline inaccurate at times. FTX\u0026rsquo;s volume monitor was a good step in the right direction there, but traders need more.\nOur current platform is a bit of a mishmash of data, but it\u0026rsquo;ll shortly start to become more clear the route we\u0026rsquo;re taking. With regards to Serum, we like the idea and think this will quickly become the biggest DEX, to compete with some long-standing CEXes in the space - as such, we want to help provide support for traders where possible to enable this process.\nProvided the grant comes to fruition, we\u0026rsquo;ll be building out a full suite of analytical products for Serum, including volume and trade data. We\u0026rsquo;ll also continue building out and customizing our Serum whitelist, https://bonfida.com/dex, and will be providing instructions so that anyone interested in hosting their own can do so.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re currently also building a portfolio management platform in tandem, which will be the main offering of Bonfida; this will have all major exchanges from the get-go, but it\u0026rsquo;d be awesome to have Serum trading and portfolio management from the start. That\u0026rsquo;ll take a little extra work and some blockchain extrapolation, it\u0026rsquo;s doable though.\nThe grant amount we\u0026rsquo;re asking for is 17500 SRM - this will be to fund any design and development costs (which are stacking up and will continue to stack up as we work on Serum), whilst also enabling us to begin spending on marketing and outreach so that our analytics (and our portfolio management system in the near future) have an audience.\n Website: https://bonfida.com Bonfida DEX: https://bonfida.com/dex  Coin98 Non-Custodial Crypto Wallet and Payment Gateway\n Website: https://coin98.app  "
