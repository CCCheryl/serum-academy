## Create your SOL wallet & Deposit Funds

Serum is built on the [Solana blockchain](https://solana.com), so the first step is to create a SOL wallet. For this we recommend using [Sollet.io](https://sollet.io).

Once you arrive on [Sollet.io](https://sollet.io) for the first time you have the possibility to create a new wallet. You will be given seed words, make sure to save them offline somewhere safe. This is the only way you can recover your wallet, don’t lose them!

Once you have noted down your seeds, you will have the possibility to add a password to your [Sollet.io](https://sollet.io) wallet. Even though this is optional, it is highly recommended for your own security.

Once the password is set (or not) you have successfully created your SOL wallet. The next step will be to send SOL to your deposit address. SOL can be bought on several exchanges like [Binance](https://binance.com) or [FTX](https://ftx.com).

Now, let’s add some SOL to our wallet. For this you need to click on **Receive**. A pop up will appear with your SOL address. Use this address to send SOL from an exchange. (**Only send SOL to this address, do not send SPL tokens (e.g. SRM) to this address**)

Now that you have some SOL in your wallet you can create another SPL address in your wallet. For this click on the **+** icon in the top right corner. A pop up will appear, you will have the possibility to add a popular SPL token such as: **SRM** or **MSRM**. Or to use a manual input.

Let’s add some **SRM** to our wallet. For this you need to click on **Add (+)**, this will simply create a new address attached to your wallet. Now you can see that below your SOL address a SRM address appeared. You can use this address to send and receive funds to your [Sollet.io](https://sollet.io) wallet.

If you would like to add another token, you can add it manually by entering the **Mint Address** of the token.

Now we have deposited some tokens in our [Sollet.io](https://sollet.io) wallet. Time to do a trade on Serum!
